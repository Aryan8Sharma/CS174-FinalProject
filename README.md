# CS174-FinalProject
The aim of this project is to empower users to customize their own webpages without requiring advanced technical skills.
Iwant to create a user-friendly web application with a straightforward interface, consisting of a single text input box and an image upload feature (limited to
jpeg only).
Any text and images submitted through this interface will be automatically integrated into a designated homepage, distinct from the home page.
Because the website has such transformable
characters and takes shape according tot the user's choice, Inamed my website Fluid.
